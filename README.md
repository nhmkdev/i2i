# i2i
An application that provides drag-n-drop image conversion.

## Acknowledgments
* There are a million other apps like this. I just needed something quick that didn't involve all kinds of setup nor use a web browser.
* Some code lifted from my other image related project: [CardMaker](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker)

# Original Goal
Convert webp images to png/bmp so they could be used as windows backgrounds.

# Future
* Add ability to drop folders
* Add ability to set the dialog to "stay on top" of other windows
* Better control over the output format (per type)
* Other stuff?
